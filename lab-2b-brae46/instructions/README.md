# Lab 2B - JavaScript Part 2

### Overview

Now that we've learned some of the basics of JavaScript, it's time to use it to do some more complicated things. We will use Higher-Order Functions to sort tasks by date and hide completed tasks.

We'll also be using JavaScript to help prevent against Cross-Site-Scripting attacks. 

### Functionality

- Sort and filter data using Higher-Order Functions
- Prevent Cross-Site-Scripting attacks
- Clean up the styles
- Visually display that a task has been completed

### Concepts

- [Higher Order Functions](https://dev.to/damcosset/higher-order-functions-in-javascript-4j8b)
- [Cross-Site-Scripting Attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/dom-based)

### Technologies

- JavaScript Date Object
- Browser Storage

## Step 1: Handle Timestamps in data and sorting

By default, our data is just sorted by which tasks were added first, which doubles as the time it was added. However, sometime you might add a task that needs to be completed before a task that you already created. In that case, it would be very useful to sort the tasks by the date that they are due. In order to achieve this, we will sort the tasks array by the date property in our data.

1. Add a button (or switch) with an event listener that, when clicked, toggles between sorting your tasks by the due date, and sorting them back to the original order, the time added. You may **NOT** modify the original `tasks` array or the local storage when you sort. The original **must** remain unchanged. (Hint: Make a duplicate, then use JavaScript's built-in array function `sort()` on it.)

## Step 2: Filter out completed tasks

When we check off a task, it stays exactly where it is. Let's add functionality to hide completed tasks.

Add another button (or switch) with another event listener that, when clicked, toggles the display of completed tasks. Again, make sure the original `tasks` isn't modified.

## Step 3: Prevent Cross-Site-Scripting attacks

There are a few different kinds of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. It is important to know of them so you can prevent your website from being attacked in such a way. The following table explains the different kinds briefly:

| Name      | Definition                                                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reflected | The malicious script comes from the current HTTP request                  |
| Stored    | The malicious script comes from the server's database                     |
| DOM-based | The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code |

We're concerned mainly with the last of these, the DOM-based attack. This is where a malicious user takes advantage of a text box that posts to the website, much like what we're doing here.

There are many ways a malicious user could do this, but they almost always include writing code into the text box before submitting it. Browsers, by default, eliminate the possibility of simply submitting a `<script>` tag. Those won't work. However, if someone were to post the following as the text to a task:

```html
<img src=1 onerror="alert(`you've been hacked!`)" />
```

you will find that it indeed alerts the message.

1. Read about XSS attacks in the article linked above in the "Concepts" section

2. Use Google to find a way to prevent this sort of attack. Make the text appear as it was inserted, though. For example, if you add a task with text `'I <3 my TAs!'`, it should show up in the task list the same way.

## Tips

1. More XSS

    The TAs are liable to use any trick up their sleeves to try and Cross-Site Script your page, but here's another you can try to see if your code successfully sanitizes your data:

    ```html
    <<em><strong>Hacked?</strong></em>
    ```

    > Note: The extra `<` is intentional.

## Syntactic Sugar

**WARNING**: heavily-opinionated section!

This:

```JavaScript
toggleSort() {
  currentlySorting = !currentlySorting
  /* ... */
}

/* ... */

if (currentlySorting) {
  /* ... */
}
```

is better than this:

```JavaScript
toggleSort() {
  currentlySorting += 1
  /* ... */
}

/* ... */

if (currentlySorting % 2 === 0) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## UML Diagram
- [ ] UML Diagram in digital from, showing functionality of sorting tasks

# Extra Credit

> Note: TAs cannot help you with extra credit!

- [ ] Use an external JavaScript Library in an interesting and useful way
- [ ] Get the sorting and filtering to stay after a page refresh
- [ ] Get the date to default to today's date

# Writeup Questions

- How did you protect your site against Cross-Site Scripting? Which type of Cross-Site Scripting did you protect against?
- What is a Higher-Order Function?
- What are the differences between the `oninput`, `onkeyup`, and `onchange` events? When do they trigger, when might you use one over the others?
